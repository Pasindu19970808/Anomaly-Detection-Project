# Anomaly-Detection-Project

This project intends to identify the location of anomaly in time series data. The dataset used for this is from the KDD Cup 2021. 
Multiple timeseries datasets are used and the anomaly location is presented in the following format:

<table>
   <tr>
    <th>No.</th>
    <th>Location of Anomaly</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>1</td>
    <td>120</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
      <td>2</td>
      <td>240</td>
  </tr>
</table>

Where No. is the id of the time series data.
